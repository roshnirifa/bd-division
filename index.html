                <h1>Bangladesh</h1>
                <p>Bangladesh, to the east of India on the Bay of Bengal, is a South Asian country marked by lush
                    greenery
                    and many waterways. Its Padma (Ganges), Meghna and Jamuna rivers create fertile plains, and travel
                    by
                    boat is common. On the southern coast, the Sundarbans, an enormous mangrove forest shared with
                    Eastern
                    India, is home to the royal Bengal tiger. Bangladesh did not exist as an independent state until
                    1971.
                    Willem van Schendel's state-of-the-art history navigates the extraordinary twists and turns that
                    created
                    modern Bangladesh through ecological disaster, colonialism, partition, a war of independence and
                    cultural renewal.</p>
                <p>Bangladesh officially known as the People's Republic of Bangladesh is an independent nation located
                    in
                    South Asia. It makes up the eastern and largest portion of the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal. It
                    is
                    situated at the zenith of the Bay of Bengal and is bordered by Myanmar and India, and separated from
                    Bhutan and Nepal by the thin Siliguri Corridor.
